# Recognizing  hand-written digits using a k-nearest neighbours classifier

This example is strongly inspired by [scikit-learn example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-digits-classification-py).

Mathematical formulae are rendered beautifully in comments thanks to [mathfmt](https://github.com/mmcloughlin/mathfmt)
